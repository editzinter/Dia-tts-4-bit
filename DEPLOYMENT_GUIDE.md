```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository for GitHub

```bash
# Run the preparation script
./prepare_github.sh

# This will:
# - Initialize git repository
# - Create .gitignore
# - Create LICENSE file
# - Create GitHub templates
# - Add all files to git
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `dia-tts-4bit` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it public for open source distribution
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Commit initial version
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dia-1.6B 4-bit quantization project

- Add core quantization scripts with multiple methods
- Add preset-based quantization for easy use
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
- Add benchmarking and testing tools
- Add GitHub workflows for CI/CD
- Support for 4GB VRAM hardware optimization"

# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dia-tts-4bit.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Pre-Quantized Models (Optional)

Since the original model is large, consider creating pre-quantized versions:

```bash
# After deployment, on a machine with sufficient resources:

# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dia-tts-4bit.git
cd dia-tts-4bit

# Run setup
./setup.sh

# Create quantized models
python preset_quantize.py --preset ultra_low_vram --output ./quantized_models/dia-1.6b-ultra-low-vram
python preset_quantize.py --preset balanced --output ./quantized_models/dia-1.6b-balanced
python preset_quantize.py --preset high_quality --output ./quantized_models/dia-1.6b-high-quality

# Create release with quantized models
# (Upload to GitHub Releases due to file size)
```

### Step 5: Set Up GitHub Releases

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
4. Release title: `Dia-1.6B 4-Bit Quantized Models v1.0.0`
5. Description:
```markdown
# Dia-1.6B 4-Bit Quantized TTS Models

This release provides quantized versions of the Dia-1.6B text-to-speech model optimized for different hardware configurations.

## 📦 Available Models

- **Ultra Low VRAM** (2-4GB VRAM): `dia-1.6b-ultra-low-vram.zip`
- **Balanced** (4-6GB VRAM): `dia-1.6b-balanced.zip`
- **High Quality** (6-8GB VRAM): `dia-1.6b-high-quality.zip`

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the appropriate model for your hardware
2. Extract to `./quantized_models/`
3. Use with: `python examples/generate_speech.py --model ./quantized_models/MODEL_NAME`

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Model | VRAM Usage | Quality | Speed |
|-------|------------|---------|-------|
| Ultra Low VRAM | ~2.5GB | 90-95% | 1.2x faster |
| Balanced | ~3.5GB | 95-98% | 1.1x faster |
| High Quality | ~4.5GB | 98-99% | 1.0x faster |

See README.md for detailed usage instructions.
```

6. Upload quantized model files (if created)
7. Publish release

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### Enable GitHub Features

1. **Issues**: Enable issue tracking
2. **Discussions**: Enable for community support
3. **Wiki**: Enable for extended documentation
4. **Projects**: Create project board for development tracking

### Set Up Branch Protection

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date

### Configure GitHub Actions

The included workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) will:
- Test on multiple Python versions
- Verify imports and basic functionality
- Run code quality checks
- Test model loading (with timeout for CI limits)
